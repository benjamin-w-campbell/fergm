Overview
--------

Frailty Exponential Random Graph Models (FERGMs) are a class of social network models designed to assess the generative structure of a network while accounting for unobserved heterogeneity in sender or reciever effects.  For further reading, see Box-Steffensmeier et. al (2017) <doi:10.7910/DVN/K3D1M2>.


Installation
------------

The most up to date version of this package is available on Benjamin Campbell's GitHub (https://github.com/benjamin-w-campbell/fergm).   While Ben tries his best to keep the development version stable, the version on CRAN will always be the most stable.
