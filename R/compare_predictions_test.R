#' KS Test for Difference in Predictive Performance
#'
#' This is a plot function to determine whether the distributions of predictions from ERGM and FERGM objects differ.  It does so by using a Kolmogorov-Smirnov Test.
#' @param compare_predictions_out Matrix of correctly predicted ties produced by the \code{compare_predictions} function.
#' @param alpha_level The significance level that should be used for the test.
#' @keywords Fit GOF Prediction KS Kolmogorov-Smirnov Test
#' @return Returns \code{ks.test} output to determine if the percent of correctly predicted ERGM ties are less than those of the FERGM and prints a message to assist with interpretation
#' @examples
#' # load example data
#' data("ergm.fit")
#' data("fergm.fit")
#' data("mesa")
#' # Use built in compare_predictions function to compare predictions of ERGM and FERGM,
#' # few replications due to example
#' predict_out <- compare_predictions(ergm.fit = ergm.fit, fergm.fit = fergm.fit,
#'                                    net = mesa, replications = 10, seed = 12345)
#'
#' # We can also conduct a KS test to determine if the FERGM fit it statistically
#'  # distinguishable from the ERGM fit
